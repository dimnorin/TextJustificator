Text Justificator
------------
<p>
This is utility to split input text into paragraphs and justify it, e.g.
format it to become text with width N (20 - 120) characters aligned to the
right and the left edge. Line width should be increased by adding spaces -
one by one, starting from the right. The end of the paragraph is a string
that ends in the corresponding punctuation. New paragraphs should indent four
spaces. Paragraph of a single line less than half of N - is the title and its
justify not needed.
